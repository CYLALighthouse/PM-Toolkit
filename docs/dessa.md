# DESSA Strategies

When it comes down to coming up with lessons for your students, always remember you do not have to reinvent the wheel. On the DESSA home page, you can look up strategies/lessons that you can use for your students. Remember, they are templates for your to use, you still need to add your student(s) specific needs. Please follow the steps below to get to the lessons.

- This is the page that you go to to log in to fill out your DESSA reports. So go ahead and sign in.

- It usually has a "Teacher Reflection and Action" template, and the rest are universal templates that you can use. 

For example, if I chose _Self Awareness_, like I did in the picture, and I were facilitating a Behavior Lesson Plan I would click on _A Time I Helped_. It will pop up a pdf that has the lesson already built out for me. I would read through the entire lesson and modify it for my student and make sure that it suits them the best it can. 

The lesson looks something like this...
