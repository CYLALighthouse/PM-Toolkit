# Math Toolkit

The Math Toolkit is used to identify what are the foundational learning gaps for their students. It is used after the student has taken the HMH test and the Near-Peer has decided what skill they want to work on with their student(s). If you have not picked out a skill, please refer back to the [Sam Report](https://cylalighthouse.github.io/CYLA_Assessments_Toolkit/#/sam?id=mi-report-summaries) in the MI section to pick your skill.

After you have picked your skill refer to the interactive pdf below to find what Standard you would like to work on for the six week period.

If you need help please follow the steps below to help you out.

### Step 1: Use your skill that you picked from your SAM report and identify it on the _Standard Focus Column_.

### Step 2: Once you find and compare the Standard Focus to your skill, go ahead and click on the _Standard_ deinfed next to it and it will take you to the _Standard Outline_.

- In the Standard outline, it tells you the scaffolding skills that the student will be learning for the next six weeks. It also give you Key Concepts/Vocab and a pre-built lessonfor you to use. 

### Step 3: _**Optional**_ Use the pre-built lesson that is provided and break it down so you can help scaffold the skill for your student. Always remember to adjust accordingly to your specific students needs.
