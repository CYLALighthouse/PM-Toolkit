# The Math Inventory (MI)

- **What is it:**
	- The *Math Inventory* is a research-based, computer adaptive assessment that measures abilities and longitudinal process from Kindergarten through Algebra II.

- **We use this to:**
	- Determine the students who will be on your Math Focus List (FL)
	- Group FL Students based on common skill gaps
	- Identify specific foundational skills and concepts students are ready to learn, so they might master grade-level content
	- Aligning skills and concpets to CCSS [(Common Core State Standards)](http://www.corestandards.org/read-the-standards/)
	- Partners with [Quantiles.com](https://www.quantiles.com/) to provide resources for Session Plan creation and a self-directed study of Math skills and concepts

!> 	MI is **not timed**. 
	Each student will answer approximately **25-45 questions**.
	Most students take **25-60 minutes** to complete one administration.
	The assessment is computer-adaptive and adjusts question difficulty based on students' responses.



## Test Mechanics 

The MI provides two benchmarks for FL Identification and student progress monitoring
- Peformance Bands: <font color = "red">FL Identification</font>
- Average Growth Goals: <font color = "red">Student Progress Monitoring & Outcome Measurement</font>

**Performance Bands** 
- Align a student's quantile score with proficiency for their grade level
- Determine Final Focus List selection (must be _Basic_ or _below_ to qualify) for the Math FL
- Provide a benchmark for monitoring student progress toward grade level proficiency



### Fall MI Performance Bands

- Applied to the first administration of the MI (Baseline Score) 
- Used for Final Focus List Selection

**How to use this chart:**
1. Find your student's grade.
2. Find the score range from their first administration. 
3. Identify the corresponding band.
4. If the student is **Far Below Basic, Below Basic**, or **Basic**, the students are <font color=green>eligible</font> for the ELA FL.
5. If the student is **Proficient** or **Advanced**, the students are <font color=red> NOT eligible</font> for the ELA FL.

### Spring MI Performance Bands

- Applied to second and third administration of the MI.
- Used as Benchmark for student progress towards grade-level proficiency.

### Average Growth Goals

- The **Average Growth Goal** is an estimate of the amount of quantile growth that an average student (50th percentile) can be expected to grow following a full year of instruction.
- Calculated based on **student grade level** and their [**Fall Performance Band**](#fall-mi-performance-band).
- Provides attainable, realistic goals to set with students.
- Serve as the main data point used for:
	- Student Progress Monitoring
	- End of Year Student Outcome

!> **The Difference Between MI and RI Growth Goals** For the MI, growth goals are based on the [Average Growth Goals](#average-growth-goals) chart, and are the **same** for all students in a grade at each performance band. For the RI, growth goals are **different** for each student, even if they are in the same grade and performance band. RI growth goals can be exported from a the [RI Growth Goals Report](sam.md).

### The Quantile Framework

The MI is based on the Quantile framework for mathematics that:
- Identifies a student's mathematical readiness to learn new skills and concepts
- Links student's readiness with specific skills and concepts that lead to Algebra Readiness & College Career Readiness
- Aligns to Common Core and Individual State standards.

The MI assesses student understanding across 5 mathematical strands:
1. Numbers and Operations
2. Algebraic Thinking, Pattern and Proportional Reasoning
3. Geometry, Measurement, and Data
4. Statistics and Probability
5. Expressions and Equations, Algebra, and Functions

?> **Computer Adaptive Design**		As students progress through the assessment, the difficulty level of questions change according to the students' performance. If the student correctly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question increase. If the student incorrectly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question decreases. The assessment ends once the student has answered a sufficient number of questions to determine an accurate Lexile measure.
